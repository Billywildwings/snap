[![Snap Status](https://build.snapcraft.io/badge/nodesource/distributions.svg)](https://build.snapcraft.io/user/nodesource/distributions)

> Snaps are containerised software packages that are simple to create and install. They auto-update and are safe to run. And because they bundle their dependencies, they work on all major Linux systems without modification.

This is a work in progress, currently supporting Node.js Nightly versions, updated every 24 hours from the Node.js _master_ branch.

1. **Install snapd on your distribution:** https://docs.snapcraft.io/core/install
2. **Install Node.js Nightly**: `$ snap install node --edge`
